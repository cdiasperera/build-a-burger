## The Build-A-Burger App
This web app was created, by following the [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

The app itself is quite simple. It lets the user "create" a dynamic burger,
from a list of ingredients, with a visual representation.

Currently, there are no plans to extend the app beyond what the course
itself implements, but that may change at a future date.
